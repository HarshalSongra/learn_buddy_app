<h3>Why C++ Programming?</h3>
<p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming.<br /> language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.<br /> C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both highlevel and low-level language features.<br /> C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.<br /> C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Object-Oriented Programming:</h4>
<p>C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:<br /><br /> 1. Encapsulation.<br /> 2. Data hiding.<br /> 3. Inheritance.<br /> 4. Polymorphism.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Standard Libraries:</h4>
<p>Standard C++ consists of three important parts:<br /> 1. The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.<br /> 2. The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.<br /> 3. The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.<br /><br /></p>
<h5>Simple C++ Program:</h5>
<p>#include &lt; iostream &gt;<br /> using namespace std;<br /> int main()<br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World";<br /> return 0;<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Access Specifiers:</h4>
<p>By now, you are quite familiar with the public keyword that appears in all of our class examples:<br /> The public keyword is an access specifier. Access specifiers define how the members (attributes and methods) of a class can be accessed. In the example above, the members are public - which means that they can be accessed and modified from outside the code.<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> class MyClass <br />{ // The class<br /> public: // Access specifier<br /> // class members goes here<br /> };<br /><br /> In C++, there are three access specifiers:<br /> 1. public - members are accessible from outside the class.<br /> 2. private - members cannot be accessed (or viewed) from outside the class.<br /> 3. protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes. You will learn more about Inheritance later.<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> class MyClass {<br /> public: // Public access specifier<br /> int x; // Public attribute<br /> private: // Private access specifier<br /> int y; // Private attribute<br /> };<br /> int main() {<br /> MyClass myObj;<br /> myObj.x = 25; // Allowed (public)<br /> myObj.y = 50; // Not allowed (private)<br /> return 0;<br /> }</p>
<h4>C++ Constructors:</h4>
<p>A constructor in C++ is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.<br /> To create a constructor, use the same name as the class, followed by parentheses ():<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> class MyClass <br />{ // The class<br /> public: // Access specifier<br /> MyClass() <br />{ // Constructor<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";<br /> }<br /> };<br /> int main() <br />{<br /> MyClass myObj; // Create an object of MyClass (this will call the constructor)<br /> return 0;<br /> }<br /><br /> <strong>Constructor Parameters:</strong><br /> Example:<br /><br /> class Car <br />{ // The class<br /> public: // Access specifier<br /> string brand; // Attribute<br /> string model; // Attribute<br /> int year; // Attribute<br /> Car(string x, string y, int z)<br /> { // Constructor with parameters<br /> brand = x;<br /> model = y;<br /> year = z;<br /> } <br /> };<br /><br /> int main()<br /> {<br /> // Create Car objects and call the constructor with different values<br /> Car carObj1("BMW", "X5", 1999);<br /> Car carObj2("Ford", "Mustang", 1969);<br /><br /> // Print values<br /> cout &lt;&lt; carObj1.brand &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; carObj1.model &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; carObj1.year &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /> cout &lt;&lt; carObj2.brand &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; carObj2.model &lt;&lt; " " &lt;&lt; carObj2.year &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /> return 0;<br /> }</p>
<h4>C++ Compiler:</h4>
<p>This is an actual C++ compiler, which will be used to compile your source code into final executable program.<br /> Most C++ compilers don't care what extension you give to your source code, but if you don't specify otherwise, many will use .cpp by default.<br /> Most frequently used and free available compiler is GNU C/C++ compiler, otherwise you can have compilers either from HP or Solaris if you have the respective Operating Systems.<br /><br /><br /> When we consider a C++ program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. Let us now briefly look into what a class, object, methods, and instant variables mean.<br /> 1. <strong>Object</strong> - Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging, barking, and eating. An object is an instance of a class.<br /> 2. <strong>Class</strong> - A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behaviors/states that object of its type support.<br /> 3. <strong>Methods</strong> - A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.<br /> 4. <strong>Instant Variables</strong> - Each object has its unique set of instant variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instant variables.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Variable Definition in C++:</h4>
<p>A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable.<br /> A variable definition specifies a data type, and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows:<br /> data_type variable_list;<br /><br /></p>
<h5>Sata types in C++ are:</h5>
<p>1. <strong>int</strong> : stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123.<br /> 2. <strong>double</strong> : stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99.<br /> 3. <strong>char</strong> : stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes.<br /> 4. <strong>string</strong> : stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes.<br /> 5. <strong>bool</strong> : stores values with two states: true or false.</p>
<h5>Declaring (Creating) Variables:</h5>
<p><strong>Syntax</strong>: type variable = value;<br /><br /></p>
<h5>Local Variables:</h5>
<p>Variables that are declared inside a function or block are local variables. They can be used only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not known to functions outside their own.<br /> Following is the example using local variables:<br /><br /> #include &lt; iostream &gt;<br /> using namespace std;<br /> int main ()<br /> {<br /> // Local variable declaration:<br /> int a, b;<br /> int c;<br /> // actual initialization<br /> a = 10;<br /> b = 20;<br /> c = a + b;<br /> cout &lt;&lt; c;<br /> return 0;<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Global Variables:</h4>
<p>Global variables are defined outside of all the functions, usually on top of the program. The global variables will hold their value throughout the life-time of your program.<br /> A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for use throughout your entire program after its declaration.<br /> Following is the example using global and local variables:<br /><br /> #include &lt; iostream &gt;<br /> using namespace std;<br /> // Global variable declaration:<br /> int g;<br /> int main ()<br /> {<br /> // Local variable declaration:<br /> int a, b;<br /> // actual initialization<br /> a = 10;<br /> b = 20;<br /> g = a + b;<br /> cout &lt;&lt; g;<br /> return 0;<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Comments:</h4>
<h5>C++ Single line comments:</h5>
<p>Comments can be used to explain C++ code, and to make it more readable. It can also be used to prevent execution when testing alternative code. Comments can be singled-lined or multi-lined.<br /> Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).<br /> Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by the compiler (will not be executed).<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> // This is a comment<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";<br /><br /></p>
<h5>C++ Multi-line Comments:</h5>
<p>Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.<br /> Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by the compiler:<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> /* The code below will print the words Hello World!<br /> to the screen, and it is amazing */<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Hello World!";<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ User Input:</h4>
<p>You have already learned that cout is used to output (print) values. Now we will use cin to get user input.<br /> cin is a predefined variable that reads data from the keyboard with the extraction operator (&gt;&gt;).<br /><br /> *Example:<br /> int x; <br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Type a number: "; // Type a number and press enter<br /> cin &gt;&gt; x; // Get user input from the keyboard<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Your number is: " &lt;&lt; x; // Display the input value<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Operators:</h4>
<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.<br /> Example:<br /> int x = 100 + 50;<br /><br /> + : For addition of toe Elements(eg. X + Y )<br /> - : For Substraction of two Elements(eg. X - Y )<br /> * : For Multiplication of two Elements (eg. X * Y )<br /> / : For Division of two Elements (eg. X * Y )<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Control Statements in C++</h4>
<h4>The if Statement:</h4>
<p><strong>C++ If ... Else:</strong><br /> Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true.<br /> Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false<br /><br /> Syntax:<br /> if (condition) <br /> {<br /> // block of code to be executed if the condition is true<br /> }<br /><br /> In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text:<br /> if (20 &gt; 18) <br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "20 is greater than 18";<br /> }<br /> else<br /> {<br /> cout&lt;&lt;"Given value not satisfying the condition";<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Nested Else If:</h4>
<p>Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.<br /> Syntax:<br /> if (condition1) <br /> {<br /> // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true<br /> }<br /> else if (condition2) <br /> {<br /> // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true<br /> }<br /> else <br /> {<br /> // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false<br /> }<br /><br /> <strong>Example</strong><br /> int time = 22;<br /> if (time &lt; 10) <br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Good morning.";<br /> }<br /> else if (time &lt; 20) <br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Good day.";<br /> }<br /> else<br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Good evening.";<br /> }<br /> // Outputs "Good evening."<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Switch:</h4>
<p>Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.<br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong> switch(expression) <br /> {<br /> case x:<br /> // code block<br /> break;<br /> case y:<br /> // code block<br /> break;<br /> default:<br /> // code block<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h5>This is how it works:</h5>
<p>*The switch expression is evaluated once.<br /> *The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.<br /> *If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.<br /> *The break and default keywords are optional, and will be described later in this chapter.<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong> int day = 4;<br /> switch (day)<br /> {<br /> case 1: cout &lt;&lt; "Monday"; break;<br /> case 2: cout &lt;&lt; "Tuesday"; break;<br /> case 3: cout &lt;&lt; "Wednesday"; break;<br /> case 4: cout &lt;&lt; "Thursday"; break;<br /> case 5: cout &lt;&lt; "Friday"; break;<br /> case 6: cout &lt;&lt; "Saturday"; break;<br /> case 7: cout &lt;&lt; "Sunday"; break;<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h4>Loops in C++:</h4>
<h5>C++ For Loop:</h5>
<p>When you know exactly how many times you want to loop through a block of code, use the for loop instead of a while loop:<br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong> for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) <br /> {<br /> // code block to be executed<br /> }<br /><br /> *Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.<br /> *Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.<br /> *Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ While Loop:</h4>
<p>*The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:<br /> Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.<br /> Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.<br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong> while (condition)<br /> {<br /> // code block to be executed<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Do/While Loop:</h4>
<p>*The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.<br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong><br /> do <br /> {<br /> // code block to be executed<br /> }while (condition);<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Break and Continue Statements:</h4>
<h5>C++ Break:</h5>
<p>You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch statement.<br /> The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop.<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)<br /> {<br /> if (i == 4)<br /> {<br /> break;<br /> }<br /> cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h5>C++ Continue:</h5>
<p>The continue statement breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) <br /> {<br /> if (i == 4) <br /> {<br /> continue;<br /> }<br /> cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Arrays:</h4>
<p>Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.<br /> To declare an array, define the variable type, specify the name of the array followed by square brackets and specify the number of elements it should store:<br /> *string cars[4];<br /> <br />To create an array of three integers, you could write:<br /> int myNum[3] = {10, 20, 30};<br /><br /></p>
<h5>Access the Elements of an Array:</h5>
<p>You access an array element by referring to the index number.<br /> This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> string cars[4] = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};<br /> cout &lt;&lt; cars[0];</p>
<h4>C++ Pointers:</h4>
<p>You learned from the previous chapter, that we can get the memory address of a variable by using the &amp; operator:<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> string food = "Pizza"; // A food variable of type string<br /> cout &lt;&lt; food; // Outputs the value of food (Pizza)<br /> cout &lt;&lt; &amp;food; // Outputs the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)<br /><br /> A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.<br /> A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator. The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:<br /> <strong>Example:</strong> string food = "Pizza"; // A food variable of type string<br /> string* ptr = &amp;food; // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of food<br /> // Output the value of food (Pizza)<br /> cout &lt;&lt; food &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /> // Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)<br /> cout &lt;&lt; &amp;food &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /> // Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)<br /> cout &lt;&lt; ptr &lt;&lt; "\n";<br /><br /> Example explained<br /> Create a pointer variable with the name ptr, that points to a string variable, by using the asterisk sign * (string* ptr). Note that the type of the pointer has to match the type of the variable you're working with.<br /> Use the &amp; operator to store the memory address of the variable called food, and assign it to the pointer.<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Functions:</h4>
<p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.<br /> You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.<br /> Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.<br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong><br /> void myFunction() <br /> {<br /> // code to be executed<br /> }<br /><br /> myFunction() is the name of the function.<br /> void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter.<br /> inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do.<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> void myFunction() <br />{<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "I just got executed!";<br /> }<br /> int main() <br /> {<br /> myFunction(); // call the function<br /> return 0;<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
<h5>C++ Function Parameters:</h5>
<p>Information can be passed to functions as a parameter. Parameters act as variables inside the function.<br /> Parameters are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many parameters as you want, just separate them with a comma:<br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong><br /> void functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) <br /> {<br /> // code to be executed<br /> }</p>
<h4>C++ Files:</h4>
<p>The fstream library allows us to work with files.<br /> To use the fstream library, include both the standard &lt; iostream &gt; AND the &lt; fstream &gt; header file:<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong> #include &lt; iostream &gt;<br /> #include &lt; fstream &gt;<br /><br /> There are three objects included in the fstream library, which are used to create, write or read files:<br /> 1. ofstream: Creates and writes to files.<br /> 2. ifstream: Reads from files<br /> 3. fstream: A combination of ofstream and ifstream: creates, reads, and writes to files.<br /><br /> <strong>Create and Write To a File:</strong><br /> To create a file, use either the ofstream or fstream object, and specify the name of the file.<br /> To write to the file, use the insertion operator (&lt;&lt;).<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> #include &lt; iostream &gt;<br /> #include &lt; fstream &gt;<br /> using namespace std;<br /> int main() <br />{<br /> // Create and open a text file<br /> ofstream MyFile("filename.txt");<br /> // Write to the file<br /> MyFile &lt;&lt; "Files can be tricky, but it is fun enough!";<br /> // Close the file<br /> MyFile.close();<br /> }<br /><br /> <strong>Read a File:</strong><br /> To read from a file, use either the ifstream or fstream object, and the name of the file.<br /> Note that we also use a while loop together with the getline() function (which belongs to the ifstream object) to read the file line by line, and to print the content of the file:<br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> string myText;<br /> ifstream MyReadFile("filename.txt");<br /> while (getline (MyReadFile, myText)) {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; myText;<br /> }<br /> MyReadFile.close();<br /><br /></p>
<h4>C++ Exceptions:</h4>
<p>When executing C++ code, different errors can occur: coding errors made by the programmer, errors due to wrong input, or other unforeseeable things.<br /> When an error occurs, C++ will normally stop and generate an error message. The technical term for this is: C++ will throw an exception (throw an error).<br /><br /> <strong>C++ try and catch:</strong><br /> Exception handling in C++ consist of three keywords: try, throw and catch:<br /> The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.<br /> The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.<br /> The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.<br /> The try and catch keywords come in pairs:<br /><br /> <strong>Syntax:</strong><br /> try {<br /> // Block of code to try<br /> throw exception; // Throw an exception when a problem arise<br /> }<br /> catch ()<br /> {<br /> // Block of code to handle errors<br /> }<br /><br /> <strong>Example:</strong><br /> try {<br /> int age = 15;<br /> if (age &gt; 18)<br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Access granted - you are old enough.";<br /> }<br /> else<br /> {<br /> throw (age);<br /> }<br /> }<br /> catch (int myNum)<br /> {<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.\n";<br /> cout &lt;&lt; "Age is: " &lt;&lt; myNum;<br /> }<br /><br /></p>
